I am a certified Acro Revolution teacher based in Washington, DC. Over the last few years I've traveled the country going to festivals, training, and playing with some of the most advanced acrobats. I've learned quite a bit including some unique tricks and subtle  techniques. Now I want to share that knowledge with you.
