The D.C. Acrobatic Convention will bring together acrobats from around the country. Come and enjoy 3 amazing days of partner acrobatics, starting Friday and going through Sunday. Xtreme Acro and Cheer is a world-class gymnastics facility with more than 70 national champion titles in gymnastic acro, in addition to numerous international titles. This state-of-the-art 11,500 square foot facility is fully air-conditioned. There are two full 42x42 acrobatic gymnastics spring floors and two training belts above the acrobatics floor - including a twisting belt!

I will be teaching a workshops with Maren Hill on Sunday afternoon.
