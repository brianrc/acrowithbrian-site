AcroLove Festival is coming to the East Coast! Come spend the weekend in the US Capitol doing tons of acro with a supportive community of talented practitioners and amazing teachers! Beginner to advanced classes will be offered every session. The festival is at the Washington Convention Center in a pristine 18,000 square foot space that is walking distance to the museums, memorials, and White House. On Friday there will be an Acro Tour of DC, and on Saturday night a party with performances, acro olympics, and a dance party/acro jam! Come join us for a weekend filled with community, play, and AcroLove!

I will be teaching a workshops with Maren Hill on Sunday afternoon.
