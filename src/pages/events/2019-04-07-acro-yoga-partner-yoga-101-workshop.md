Join us for an AcroYoga workshop. AcroYoga is a fun and uplifting practice which combines the playfulness of partner acrobatics with the mindfulness of yoga. Working in partnership with others, the practice builds trust, communication, flexibility, and strength. Experience the joy of flying, the power of supporting another human being, all with the safety of a spotter. No partner or experience necessary.

DATE:
April 7 11-1pm
$35 ($25 for Supreme Members)
