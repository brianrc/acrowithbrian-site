AcroYoga is a fun and uplifting practice that can be both playful and challenging, plus it compliments your climbing routine. AcroYoga combines the playfulness of partner acrobatics with the mindfulness of yoga, and the creativity of dance. Working in partnership with others, the practice builds trust, communication, connection, flexibility, and strength. No partner or experience necessary.
