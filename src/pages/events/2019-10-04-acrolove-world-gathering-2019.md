Come join us for the largest gathering of acrobats in North America! The goal of this festival is to build community by bringing all styles of acrobatics from all over the world together to celebrate our collective love of acro. We invite you to be a part of this supportive, ever-evolving community of talented practitioners and amazing teachers. Make new friends, learn new skills, and share the global AcroLove!

I will be teaching with Maren Hill.
