Join Brian Cruikshank and Maren Hill for a spin filled AcroYoga workshop where we'll share some of our favorite washing machines. What's a Washing Machine? It's a dynamic sequence of AcroYoga poses that ends where it began, creating a repeatable cycle. In the workshop we’ll explore timing, body placement, weight transfer, and dynamic transitions to find ease and fluidity in each cycle. Take one step towards ALL THE WASHING MACHINES!

No partner necessary!

Pre-reqs: side-star, back bird, bird

Investment: $30 - income based sliding scale available (please paypal maren.hill@gmail.com to reserve your spot or contact to find out about sliding scale)

Since it’s Halloween weekend, costumes are encouraged, but not required. Just make sure costumes allow for the ancient acro art of schmearing (to slide one’s foot across a flyers hip, back or thigh to achieve a more desirable placement).
