Come spend New Years in sunny San Diego on the water with tons of acro and a supportive community of talented practitioners and amazing teachers! Beginner to advanced classes will be offered every session. The festival is at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina overlooking downtown San Diego in a pristine 14,000 square foot space. The 4-star hotel is on the water overlooking downtown San Diego. It has hot tubs, pools, restaurants, Starbucks, and amazing views in all directions. On Friday there will be a Sunset Acro jam on the beach in downtown Ocean Beach. News Year Eve we will have a party with performances, acro olympics, and a dance party/acro jam! Come join us for a weekend filled with community, play, and AcroLove!

I'll be attending the San Diego AcroLove for the first time. Come play!
