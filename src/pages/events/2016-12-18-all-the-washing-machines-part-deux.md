Steal the show with these whirly, twirly AcroYoga washing machines. Join Brian Cruikshank and Maren Hill for another spin filled Acro workshop where you'll learn the tricks to master two amazing flowy machines and impress your friends.

What's a Washing Machine? It's a dynamic sequence of AcroYoga poses that ends where it begins, creating a repeatable cycle. In the workshop weâ€™ll explore timing, body movement, weight transfer, and dynamic transitions to find ease and fluidity in each cycle. Take another step toward mastering ALL THE WASHING MACHINES!
