Hi! I'm Brian Cruikshank. I am a certified Acro Revolution teacher based in Washington, D.C.

I've been playing with acro for over 5 years, traveling the country and discovering some of the most advanced techniques and moves. Now I want to teach you!

### Private Lessons
I offer 1.5 hour private acro lessons for $90 and you can include up to 2 friends at no extra charge.

### Classes and Workshops
I co-teach a regular class with Maren Hill at Earth Treks Crystal City every 1st and 3rd Monday of the month at 8:30pm.

Maren and I sometimes offer intermediate workshops too. Check the events page.

### Photography
I've been photographing acro and events for 3 years. All the pictures on this site are mine. Let me know if you're interested in acro photography.

### Web Development
I design and build professional websites for a living including the one you see here. You can find more of my work at https://www.brianswebstudio.com
