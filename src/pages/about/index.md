Hi! I'm Brian Cruikshank. I am a certified Acro Revolution teacher based in Washington, D.C.

I've been practicing acro for over 6 years, traveling the country, and learning some of the most advanced movements and techniques. 

Some places I've taught acro at include NY Acrofest, AcroLove East Coast, DC Acrobatic Convention, and the Interfusion Festival. 

When I'm not teaching I'm always learning. I'm also an avid rock climber, traveler, an activist for things that matter.

### Private Lessons
I offer 1.5 hour private acro lessons for $90. You can include up to 2 friends at no extra charge.

### Classes and Workshops
I co-teach a regular class with Maren Hill at Earth Treks Crystal City every 1st and 3rd Monday of the month at 8:30pm.

Maren and I sometimes offer intermediate workshops too and travel to festivals. Check the events page.

### Photography
I've been photographing acro and events for 3 years. All the pictures on this site are mine. Let me know if you're interested in photography.

### Web Development
I design and build professional websites for a living including the one you see here. You can find more of my work at https://www.brianswebstudio.com
