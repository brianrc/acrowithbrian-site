This is my personal acro yoga teacher website.

Made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an amazing React static site generator.

The theme is custom, built on top of [Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)

So thankful for the helpful community and the amazing work being done there.

Other components include:
* [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/intljusticemission/react-big-calendar)
* [react-grid-gallery](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery)

Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
